# My VIM configuration

I work daily with vim from I was a child, and this is my actual vim configuration.

## Installation

1. Go to your home folder, clone this repository and rename it to .vim::

    `cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/juanmitaboada/vim && mv vim .vim`

2. Install dependencies (it will request your sudo password)::

    `~/.vim/vim_install_plugins.sh`

3. Let install all plugins::

   `cd ~/.vim/bundle/ && ./update.sh`

4. You are ready to go
