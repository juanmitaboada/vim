## Installation

Before you go, make sure you make a backup of your current vim configuration, go to your home folder and rename both .vim folder and .vimrc file to a different name:

    cd ~ && mv .vimrc .vimrc.backup && mv .vim .vim.backup

Let's install:

1. Go to your home folder, clone this repository, and rename it to .vim:

    cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/juanmitaboada/vim && mv vim .vim

2. Link .vimrc into your home folder:

    `ln -s .vim/.vimrc`

3. Install dependencies (it will request your sudo password):

    `~/.vim/vim_install_plugins.sh`

4. Let's install all plugins:

   `cd ~/.vim/bundle/ && ./update.sh`

5. You are ready to go
